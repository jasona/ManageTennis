        <p>Welcome to the C4 Tennis Academy.</p>
        <p>The 4 Cs represent <b>Commitment, Consistency, Courage, and Character to produce Champions</b>, in tennis and in life.  At C4 we wholeheartedly embrace these concepts as we will work to unleash your childs potential. Tennis is a sport in which physical strength, mental toughness, excellent technique, and discipline are essential components of the game. We believe that focusing on excelling in these four elements of tennis provides valuable training instruments and experiences that are crucial to achieving objectives both on, and off, the court. </p>
        <p>Our philosophy and goal is to teach our players the importance of work ethic, character, responsibility and handling adversity. C4 Academy will train our students to be the best tennis player and person they can be in tennis and in all aspects of life. With the appropriate physical, mental, and technique training our players will have the opportunity to become top high school, collegiate, and even professional athletes.</p>
