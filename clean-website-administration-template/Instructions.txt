--TABLE OF CONTENTS--

A) HTML Structure 
B) CSS Files
C) Javascript 
D) PSD Files
E) jQuery

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A) HTML Structure

This theme is a fixed layout with one or two columns. 
All of the information within the main content area is nested within a div with an id of "mainCol". 

The sidebar's (column #2) content is within a div with an id of "sideCol". 

To create a single column layout, use one-column.html as a starting template.

Theme Colors
To change the theme colors, just change which stylesheet is used in the <head> of the website.
Orange Example: <link href="css/admin-orange.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" />
Green Example: <link href="css/admin-green.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" />
Blue Example: <link href="css/admin-blue.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" />
Red Example: <link href="css/admin-red.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" />

If you would like to edit the color, font, or style of any elements beyond this, you would do the following:

- Find the element ID or Class in the HTML (ex: id="menu")
- Look in css/screen.css for the class / id name (ex: #menu)
- See what attributes are applied to that class / id, making any changes if needed

The majority of color changes can be done simply looking for "color:#xxxxxx" or background:" in the style sheet.

Included HTML Files:
There are named static HTML files and one PHP file (see section E). Each of these files is named for the area it represents
along with some sample content. The contact page uses a form that submits to a php page, sending mail then redirecting to
a thank you page. Please see the PHP section for more information.

There is also a custom 404 page which some servers can display instead of the dreaded, ugly default "page not found".

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

B) CSS

I'm using one CSS file per color in this theme. The first statement is a generic reset statement. 
Many browser interpret the default behavior of html elements differently. 
By using a general reset CSS statement, we can work around this.

This file also contains some general styling, such as anchor tag colors, font-sizes, etc. 
Keep in mind, that these values might be overridden somewhere else in the file. 

If you would like to edit a specific section of the site, simply find the appropriate id or class in the HTML file, 
and then scroll down until you find the appropriate style that needs to be edited in the CSS file. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C) Javascript

This template uses a javascript library, jQuery to hide and show content, visit the jQuery section for more information.

The file general.js in the /js/ folder contains some added on functions. 
Some are for show in the demo, please read the comments in the file for more help.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

D) PSD Files

I've included two PSD files with this theme, one to create a custom 
menu background color and one change the logo or other attributes.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

E) jQuery

jQuery v1.3 is used for the expanding/contracting text if needed.

Thanks again for your purchase!

I'd be glad to help you if you have any questions relating to this theme, or if you need additional photos, add-ons, and so on.

No guarantees, but I'll do my best to assist. If you have a more general question relating to the themes on ThemeForest, 
you might consider visiting the forums and asking your question in the "Item Discussion" section.
